#Styling the form

While vue-form-generator is Bootstrap friendly, you may want to change the style to better suit your website.
If you want to start from zero (not recommended) just omit the `vue-form-generator.css` file.

A better way is to use `vue-form-generator.css` as a base and change from it.
