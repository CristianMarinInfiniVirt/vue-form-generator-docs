# Styling the Form

While vue-form-generator is Bootstrap friendly, you may want to change the style to better suit your website.
If you want to start from scratch (not recommended) just omit the `vue-form-generator/dist/vfg.css` import.

A better way is to use `vue-form-generator/dist/vfg.css` as a base and change from it.
